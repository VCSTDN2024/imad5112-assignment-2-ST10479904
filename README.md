Report:
The purpose of the app “Batman flashcards” is to help people gain more knowledge about Batman just in case they wanted to learn about him and what he is all about.

Design considerations:
The app has a simple design making it easy to navigate around it, the main activity screen is the welcome screen which consists of a TextView and a “Start” button. The quiz page consists of 12 Batman related questions and 3 buttons with the option to select true, false or the next question. The score screen consists of 2 TextViews which will reveal your score and whether you passed or not. The review page is a page where you are able to see the questions with the answer so that you will be able to view what mistakes you made while giving you the option to restart the quiz now that you have gained enough knowledge or it’ll give you the option to exit the app entirely.
